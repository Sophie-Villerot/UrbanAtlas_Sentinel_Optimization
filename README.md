# UrbanAtlas_Sentinel_Optimization

## Short summary

Optimization of the use of Sentinel-2 (potentially 1) images over Urbal Atlas Areas of Interest (AOIs)

## Problem

The 788 Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) delimited in the Urban Atlas project don't necessarily match perfectly the Sentinel-2A & B fixed paths, based on
the geometric overlap as well as the temporal revit time (around 5 days over Europe) of Sentinel data - level L2A, Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA).

### Data

- FUA delineation;
- Sentinel-2A & B paths/tiles.

### Going further

Could be taken into account:
- For each Sentinel image, the cloud mask.

Instead of L2A images, L3 weekly/monthly average could be used.
